# iOS Tech Challenge - Russell Warwick - Notes

Thank you for your taking the time to review my code.

I am aware that I was unable to complete a couple of the requirments due to my inexperience with SwiftUI and its state managment. I found it tricky to learn in just a short time. I have had experience in SwiftUIs usage of ResultBuilders, so much so I took the time to build this https://github.com/gymshark/ios-stack-kit.git. I would like to gain some more insight into SwiftUI and am keen to learn its statemanagment aswell as combine. Hopefully by time we sit down to talk I can go further into details about the requirments that I missed. 

Looking forard to hearing from you
